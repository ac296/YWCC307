  For my class presentation, I had to explain what was lazy functional programming. I began the presentation by explaining 
what functional programming is and displayed an example of what functional programming is which is essentially 
just any high order programming language that uses recursive functions. I gave four examples of what I believed were the main
languages that use functional programming. I then describe what "lazy" in lazy functional programming means.
Lazy evaluation in programming allows programs to avoid unneccessary tasks until they are needed. Furthermore, I explained the 
advantages and disadvantages were for lazy functional programming. Finally, I give an example of Python code using lazy functions 
and display the resources I used when researching.
